**Overview of Data Preprocessing, Regression Models, and Time-Series Techniques in Python**

The provided code examples illustrate common data preprocessing techniques and machine learning applications in Python. The first set of code examples demonstrates how to implement and visualize basic data manipulations such as plotting histograms, bar charts, and pie charts using a sample dataset. It shows how to explore and visualize the distribution of data and categorical information, which is a fundamental step in data analysis to understand data patterns and trends. The next set of code snippets focuses on implementing regression models, specifically linear and logistic regression, on sample datasets. These models are fundamental in predictive analytics and classification tasks. The logistic regression example further explores binary classification tasks, using Pythonâ€™s `make_classification` to generate synthetic datasets and evaluating model performance.

The final code examples delve into advanced techniques like creating lag features for time-series datasets. Lag features capture the historical values of a time series, which are used to predict future data points. This technique is essential for time-series forecasting tasks, as it helps incorporate temporal dependencies into the model. The code also demonstrates the use of rolling statistics such as rolling means, which provide further insights into the trend and volatility of the data over time. All the code samples use libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, essential tools for data manipulation, machine learning, and statistical modeling in Python.
